// Style controls the verbosity / format of the prompt sent to the LLM.
// Expand this enum as you experiment with new phrasing strategies.
//
//   - StyleCompact: shortest prompt, just enough to elicit JSON.
//   - StyleSchema: includes an explicit JSON schema example.
//   - StyleVerbose: adds narrative instructions for better creativity.
//
// You can set the desired style when you build your prompt.
// If you add a new style, simply extend the switch in Builder.Build.
// Existing call‚Äësites only need to swap the enum value.
//
// NOTE: Keeping prompt construction here decouples it from the service
// layer, so you can iterate quickly without touching business logic.

 **Example Problem Structure (Please aim for similar complexity and style):** **Scenario:** [briefly describe a scenario related to the user's interests] **Problem:** [state the math problem clearly] **"Problem 1","Dinosaur ü¶ñ","Imagine Amelia is exploring a land filled with dino-sauruses! She sees 12 Stegosauruses and 9 Brachiosauruses. How many dinosaurs does Amelia see in all?",‚Äùaddition‚Äù,9,12** **"Problem 2","Space üöÄ","Amelia is counting stars in the night sky. She spots 17 blue stars and 6 yellow stars. What is the total number of stars Amelia counts?",‚Äùaddition‚Äù,17,6** **"Problem 3","Unicorn ü¶Ñ","Princess Amelia has 11 sparkling unicorn charms and 7 rainbow unicorn stickers. How many unicorn goodies does she have altogether?",‚Äùaddition‚Äù,11,7** **"Problem 4","Volcano üåã","At the volcano, there are 15 red rocks and 8 black rocks. How many rocks are there in total around the volcano?",‚Äùaddition‚Äù,15,8** **Remember to:**
*   Vary the scenarios and the specific numbers used in the problems.
    
*   Ensure the problems are grammatically correct and easy to understand.
    
*   Clearly state the question being asked.
    
*   Incorporate the user's interests naturally within the problem context.
    
*   Maintain a positive and engaging tone.
    
*   Do not provide a code example just the question.
    
*   List questions in CSV form
    
*   Always start the CSV with a fixed header: "Index","theme","text","operation","num1","num2"
    
*   Add an emoji of the topic of the question next to the interest
    
*   the CSV row should have ‚ÄúProblem Number‚Äù, ‚Äútheme‚Äù, ‚Äúproblem text'‚Äú, ‚Äúoperation‚Äù, num1,num2,
    
*   If the operation is Subtraction or Division ensure that num1, num2 are in the order of the operation (avoid illogical operations based on the problem text
*   Do not generate csv markdown blocks, only the contents of the csv
